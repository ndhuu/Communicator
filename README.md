# Communicator
This is the code that I implemented during the Citibank hackathon, which includes Scheduler, API calls, SQL Query and Database Singleton Pattern. 

This is somewhat closed to our final, however, due to some technical issues, this is the only version I can find. For the final product, I have collaborated with my team to finish email and notification sending intergration, migration of the database, and completion of manual unit testing of our features.

# Background
The hackathon required us to build a micro-service web application and combine the product with other teams in the competition. My team part was Communicator, which handles sending notification during certain events of the application and sending notification periodically one day before the volunteering day for personnels involved. My team, using NodeJS as a learning and practicing opportunity, implemented a micro-service with RESTful API Call for frontend and other teams' requirements.
